    The sentiment function of textblob returns two properties, polarity, and subjectivity.

    and -1 means a negative statement.

    Subjective sentences generally refer to personal opinion, emotion or judgment whereas
    objective refers to factual information. Subjectivity is also a float which lies in
    the range of [0,1].
